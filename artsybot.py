        ('Humans didn\'t evolve from knuckle-walkers to have an upright walk - Chimpanzees and Gorillas evolved '
         'knuckle-walking after they split from humans. This might have to do with their different body structure.'),

        ('Gorillas normally walk on all fours, but are capable of walking upright when needed for short periods of '
         'time, such as when they are going to beat their chests, engage in an encounter, or are carrying something '
         '(such as food). Many funny Gifs have been made from this.'),

        ('The Great Apes are some of the few species of mammals that are known to use tools. '
         'Both bonobos and chimpanzees have been observed making "sponges" out of leaves and moss that suck up water. '
         'Many more apes in captivity use tools than those in the wild.'),

        ('To date, a total of 32 monkeys have flown in space. These species include rhesus macaques, '
         'squirrel monkeys and pig-tailed monkeys. Chimpanzees have also flown. On 4 June 1949, '

         'various space programs throughout history.'),

         'Greasy.'),

        ('The population of tribes of many species of monkeys is firmly capped below 200 because if the tribes grew '
         'larger, social grooming between tribe members would take up too much time and nothing would get done.'),

         'They also use tools more frequently in zoos than in the wild.'),

         'just like with human babies. Sad!'),

        ('Apes are capable of associating signs to real-life things, '
         'making some rudimentary communication between humans and Apes possible. '
