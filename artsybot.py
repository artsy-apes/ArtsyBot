         'knuckle-walking after they split from humans. This might have to do with their different body structure.'),

        ('The population of tribes of many species of monkeys is firmly capped below 200 because if the tribes grew '
         'larger, social grooming between tribe members would take up too much time and nothing would get done.'),
